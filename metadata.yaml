description: '"The English precursor to Wall Street, London''s Lombard Street is the
  original district of finance and the birthplace of the money market. Fast-paced
  and highly-charged, it is a hotbed of financial activity whose impact is felt not
  just nationally, but globally." "The chef d''oeuvre of Walter Bagehot, Lombard Street
  began as a series of articles the esteemed essayist and financial advisor had written
  for The Economist during the 1850s. First published in book form in 1873, it is
  a vivid description of the money market that seamlessly brings together theoretical
  analyses, historical anecdotes, and incisive commentary on sociology, politics,
  and the Street''s various personalities." "Perhaps most important, Lombard Street
  features Bagehot''s prescription for crisis management, which after nearly 150 years,
  remains the formula of choice for containing--and curtailing--financial crises"--Description
  borrowed from the dustjaket of a 1999 publication of this work by John Wiley & Sons,
